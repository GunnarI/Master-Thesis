  abstract = {Objective: Current clinical biomechanics involves lengthy data acquisition and time-consuming offline analyses with biomechanical models not operating in real-time for man-machine interfacing. We developed a method that enables online analysis of neuromusculoskeletal function in vivo in the intact human. Methods: We used electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling to simulate all transformations from muscle excitation onset (EMGs) to mechanical moment production around multiple lower-limb degrees of freedom (DOFs). We developed a calibration algorithm that enables adjusting musculoskeletal model parameters specifically to an individual's anthropometry and force-generating capacity. We incorporated the modeling paradigm into a computationally efficient, generic framework that can be interfaced in real-time with any movement data collection system. Results: The framework demonstrated the ability of computing forces in 13 lower-limb muscle-tendon units and resulting moments about three joint DOFs simultaneously in real-time. Remarkably, it was capable of extrapolating beyond calibration conditions, i.e., predicting accurate joint moments during six unseen tasks and one unseen DOF. Conclusion: The proposed framework can dramatically reduce evaluation latency in current clinical biomechanics and open up new avenues for establishing prompt and personalized treatments, as well as for establishing natural interfaces between patients and rehabilitation systems. Significance: The integration of EMG with numerical modeling will enable simulating realistic neuromuscular strategies in conditions including muscular/orthopedic deficit, which could not be robustly simulated via pure modeling formulations. This will enable translation to clinical settings and development of healthcare technologies including real-time bio-feedback of internal mechanical forces and direct patient-machine interfacing.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to assess the variability of EMG signal envelope with electrode location during gait. Surface EMG signals were recorded from 10 healthy subjects from the tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), gastrocnemius lateralis (GL), and soleus (SO) muscles. From TA, PL, GL and GM, signals were acquired using a two-dimensional grid of 4×3 electrodes (10×15mm in size, as used in most gait laboratories) with 20-mm interelectrode distance in both directions. A similar grid of 3×3 electrodes was used for SO. EMG envelope was characterized by its peak value, area after normalization by the peak value, and time instant corresponding to the maximum. The maximum relative change in peak value with electrode location, expressed as a percentage of the peak value in the central location, was (mean±SD) 31±18% for TA, 29±13% for PL, 25±15% for GL, 14±8% for GM, and 26±14% for SO. The maximum relative change in area was 29±13% for TA, 73±40% for PL, 31±23% for GL, 35±20% for GM, 20±13% for SO, and in the position of maximum, computed as distance from the maximum position in the central channel, it was 5±10% of the gait cycle for TA, 26±16% for PL, 3±2% for GL, 3±1% for GM, 3±3% for SO. A crosstalk index, defined on the basis of the expected intervals of muscle activation for healthy subjects, indicated that estimated crosstalk was present between TA and PL, in an amount which depended on electrode location. It was concluded that the estimate of muscle activation intensity during gait from surface EMG is variable with location of the electrodes while timing of muscle activity is more robust to electrode displacement and can be reliably extracted in those cases in which crosstalk is limited. These results are valid for healthy subjects, where the level of muscular activity during gait is much lower than maximum.},

In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is proposed. The method is based on the identification of single motor unit action potentials from the surface EMG signal with the use of the continuous wavelet transform. A manifestation variable is computed as the maximum of the outputs of a bank of matched filters at different scales. A threshold is applied to the manifestation variable to detect EMG activity. A model, based on the physical structure of the muscle, is used to test the proposed technique on synthetic signals with known features. The resultant bias of the onset estimate is lower than 40 ms and the standard deviation lower than 30 ms in case of additive colored Gaussian noise with signal-to-noise ratio as low as 2 dB. Comparison with previously developed methods was performed, and representative applications to experimental signals are presented. The method is designed for a complete real-time implementation and, thus, may be applied in clinical routine activity.},

Widely used single threshold methods still rely on the experience of the operator to manually establish a threshold level. In this paper, a novel approach to address this issue is presented. Based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, the maximum likelihood (ML) method is improved with an adaptive threshold technique based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimate in the initial time before accurate sEMG analyses. The dependence of optimal threshold on SNR is determined by minimizing the onset/offset estimate error on a large set of simulated signals with well-known signal parameters. Accuracy and precision of the algorithm were assessed by using a set of simulated signals and real sEMG signals recorded from two healthy subjects during elbow flexion-extension movements with and without workload. Comparison with traditional algorithms shows that with a moderate increase in the computational effort the ML algorithm performs well even for low levels of EMG activity, while the proposed adaptive method is most robust with respect to variations in SNRs. Also, we discuss the results of analyzing the sEMG recordings from the selected proximal muscles of the upper limb in two hemiparetic subjects. The detection algorithm is automatic and user-independent, managing the detection of both onset and offset activation, and is applicable in presence of noise allowing use by skilled and unskilled operators alike.},

This metric, so-called pulse-to-noise-ratio (PNR), is computationally efficient, does not require any additional experimental costs and can be applied to every MU that is identified by the previously developed convolution kernel compensation technique. Approach. The analytical derivation of the newly introduced metric is provided, along with its extensive experimental validation on both synthetic and experimental surface EMG signals with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 0 to 20 dB and muscle contraction forces from 5% to 70% of the maximum voluntary contraction. Main results . In all the experimental and simulated signals, the newly introduced metric correlated significantly with both sensitivity and false alarm rate in identification of MU discharges. Practically all the MUs with PNR > 30 dB exhibited sensitivity >90% and false alarm rates <2%. Therefore, a threshold of 30 dB in PNR can be used as a simple method for selecting only reliably decomposed units. Significance . The newly introduced metric is considered a robust and reliable indicator of accuracy of MU identification. The study also shows that high-density surface EMG can be reliably decomposed at contraction forces as high as 70% of the maximum.},

We hypothesized that setting an amplitude threshold to define when a muscle was active would remove that part of the myoelectric signal most likely to include crosstalk, without affecting the intensity or the onset and cessation times. Surface and intramuscular electrodes recorded signals from the same muscles of adults performing cyclic ankle movements and walking at self-selected speeds.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the knee flexion and the lower-limb muscle activation within the stance-to-swing phases of gait cycle in the post-stroke hemiplegic patients. Ten stroke patients and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects participated in the experiment. The lower-limb kinematic signals and the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals of the left and right rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and lateral gastrocnemius (GS) were recorded during walking. The angle range (AR) of knee flexion, the root mean square (RMS) and the mean frequency (MNF) of sEMG signals were calculated from the terminal stance (TSt) to the initial swing (ISw) phases of gait cycle. Stroke patients showed lower bilateral AR of knee flexion and lower RMS of GS on the paretic side, but higher MNF of RF on the non-paretic side compared with the controls. Within the stroke patients, significant differences were found between their paretic and non-paretic limbs in the AR of knee flexion, as well as in the RMS and MNF of GS (p < 0.05). Regression analysis showed that the RMS of BF, MNF of BF and MNF of GS explained 82.1% of variations in AR of knee flexion on paretic side (r2 = 0.821). But the RMS and MNF of all the muscles (including the RF, GS and BF) could explain 65.6% of AR of knee flexion variations on the non-paretic side (r2 = 0.656), and 45.2% of variations for the healthy subjects (r2 = 0.452). The reduced knee flexion during gait was associated with altered magnitude and frequency of muscle contractions and with simplified muscle synergy in the post-stroke hemiplegic patients. Identifying the muscles that are responsible for knee stiffness may facilitate improvement of rehabilitation strategy for post-stroke gait.},

We then use a computed muscle control (CMC) algorithm to vary muscle excitations to track experimental joint kinematics within a forward dynamic simulation. CMC explicitly accounts for delays in muscle force production resulting from activation and contraction dynamics while using a general static optimization framework to resolve muscle redundancy. CMC was used to compute muscle excitation patterns that drove a 21-degrees-of-freedom, 92 muscle model to track experimental gait data of 10 healthy young adults. Simulated joint kinematics closely tracked experimental quantities (mean root-mean-squared errors generally less than 1°), and the time histories of muscle activations were similar to electromyographic recordings. A simulation of a half-cycle of gait could be generated using approximately 30min of computer processing time. The speed and accuracy of REA and CMC make it practical to generate subject-specific simulations of gait.},

The purpose was to investigate the impact of the precision of the kinematics estimation by a myoelectric controller for accurately complete goal-directed tasks. Nine naïve subjects performed a series of goal-directed myoelectric control tasks using the three algorithms, and their online performance was characterized by 6 indexes. The results showed that, although the three algorithms' mapping accuracies were significantly different, their online performance was similar. Moreover, for LR and ANN, the offline performance was not correlated to any of the online performance indexes, and only a weak correlation was found with three of them for NMF . We conclude that for reliable simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy in the mapping between EMG and kinematics. Rather, good online myoelectric control is achieved by the continuous interaction and adaptation of the user with the myoelectric controller through feedback (visual in the current study). Control signals generated by EMG with rather poor association with kinematic variables can still be fully exploited by the user for precise control. This conclusion explains the possibility of accurate simultaneous and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom when using unsupervised algorithms, such as NMF.},

The real-time intent recognition approach utilizes a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with majority voting and threshold biasing schemes to increase its robustness. The ability of the approach to recognize in real time a person's intent to stand or walk at one of three different speeds is demonstrated on measured biomechanics data.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to characterize complexity of lower-extremity muscle coactivation and coordination during gait in children with cerebral palsy (CP), children with typical development (TD) and healthy adults, by applying recently developed multivariate multi-scale entropy (MMSE) analysis to surface electromyographic (EMG) signals. Eleven CP children (CP group), eight TD children and seven healthy adults (considered as an entire control group) were asked to walk while surface EMG signals were collected from five thigh muscles and three lower leg muscles on each leg (16 EMG channels in total). The 16-channel surface EMG data, recorded during a series of consecutive gait cycles, were simultaneously processed by multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD), to generate fully aligned data scales for subsequent MMSE analysis. In order to conduct extensive examination of muscle coactivation complexity using the MEMD-enhanced MMSE, 14 data analysis schemes were designed by varying partial muscle combinations and time durations of data segments. Both TD children and healthy adults showed almost consistent MMSE curves over multiple scales for all the 14 schemes, without any significant difference (p > 0.09). However, distinct diversity in MMSE curve was observed in the CP group when compared with the control group. There appears to be diverse neuropathological processes in CP that may affect dynamical complexity of muscle coactivation and coordination during gait. The abnormal complexity patterns emerging in the CP group can be attributed to different factors such as motor control impairments, loss of muscle couplings, and spasticity or paralysis in individual muscles. This study expands our knowledge of neuropathology of CP from a novel point of view of muscle co-activation complexity, which might be useful to derive a quantitative index for assessing muscle activation characteristics as well as motor function in CP.},

Currently, publicly available software to calculate muscle forces are restricted to static and dynamic optimisation methods, or limited to isometric tasks only. We have created and made freely available for the research community the Calibrated EMG-Informed NMS Modelling Toolbox (CEINMS), an OpenSim plug-in that enables investigators to predict different neural control solutions for the same musculoskeletal geometry and measured movements. CEINMS comprises EMG-driven and EMG-informed algorithms that have been previously published and tested. It operates on dynamic skeletal models possessing any number of degrees of freedom and musculotendon units and can be calibrated to the individual to predict measured joint moments and EMG patterns. In this paper we describe the components of CEINMS and its integration with OpenSim. We then analyse how EMG-driven, EMG-assisted, and static optimisation neural control solutions affect the estimated joint moments, muscle forces, and muscle excitations, including muscle co-contraction.},

We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

  abstract = {Musculoskeletal models are often used to estimate internal muscle forces and the effects of those forces on the development of human movement. The Hill-type muscle model is an important component of many of these models, yet it requires specific knowledge of several muscle and tendon properties. These include the optimal muscle fibre length, the length at which the muscle can generate maximum force, and the tendon slack length, the length at which the tendon starts to generate a resistive force to stretch. Both of these parameters greatly influence the force-generating behaviour of a musculotendon unit and vary with the size of the person. However, these are difficult to measure directly and are often estimated using the results of cadaver studies, which do not account for differences in subject size. This paper examined several different techniques that can be used to scale the optimal muscle fibre length and tendon slack length of a musculotendon unit according to subject size. The techniques were divided into three categories corresponding to linear scaling, scaling by maintaining a constant tendon slack length throughout the range of joint motion, and scaling by maintaining muscle operating range throughout the range of joint motion. We suggest that a good rationale for scaling muscle properties should be to maintain the same force-generating characteristics of a musculotendon unit for all subjects, which is best achieved by scaling that preserves the muscle operating range when the muscle is maximally activated.},

  abstract    = {Objectives: The development of neurorehabilitation technologies requires the profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying an individual's motor ability and impairment. A major factor limiting this understanding is the difficulty of bridging between events taking place at the neurophysiologic level (i.e., motor neuron firings) with those emerging at the musculoskeletal level (i.e. joint actuation), in vivo in the intact moving human. This review presents emerging model-based methodologies for filling this gap that are promising for developing clinically viable technologies. Methods: We provide a design overview of musculoskeletal modeling formulations driven by recordings of neuromuscular activity with a critical comparison to alternative model-free approaches in the context of neurorehabilitation technologies. We present advanced electromyography-based techniques for interfacing with the human nervous system and model-based techniques for translating the extracted neural information into estimates of motor function. Results: We introduce representative application areas where modeling is relevant for accessing neuromuscular variables that could not be measured experimentally. We then show how these variables are used for designing personalized rehabilitation interventions, biologically inspired limbs, and human-machine interfaces. Conclusion: The ability of using electrophysiological recordings to inform biomechanical models enables accessing a broader range of neuromechanical variables than analyzing electrophysiological data or movement data individually. This enables understanding the neuromechanical interplay underlying in vivo movement function, pathology, and robot-assisted motor recovery. Significance: Filling the gap between our understandings of movement neural and mechanical functions is central for addressing one of the major challenges in neurorehabilitation: personalizing current technologies and interventions to an individual's anatomy and impairment.},

In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion–extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor–extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed.},

Existing deep learning architectures are mainly based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which captures spatial information of electromyogram signal. Motivated by the sequential nature of electromyogram signal, we propose an attention-based hybrid CNN and RNN (CNN-RNN) architecture to better capture temporal properties of electromyogram signal for gesture recognition problem. Moreover, we present a new sEMG image representation method based on a traditional feature vector which enables deep learning architectures to extract implicit correlations between different channels for sparse multi-channel electromyogram signal. Extensive experiments on five sEMG benchmark databases show that the proposed method outperforms all reported state-of-the-art methods on both sparse multi-channel and high-density sEMG databases. To compare with the existing works, we set the window length to 200ms for NinaProDB1 and NinaProDB2, and 150ms for BioPatRec sub-database, CapgMyo sub-database, and csl-hdemg databases. The recognition accuracies of the aforementioned benchmark databases are 87.0%, 82.2%, 94.1%, 99.7% and 94.5%, which are 9.2%, 3.5%, 1.2%, 0.2% and 5.2% higher than the state-of-the-art performance, respectively.},

  abstract = {Optimization theory and other mathematical algorithms have traditionally been used to model the relationship between muscle activity and lower-limb dynamics during human gait. We introduce here an alternative approach, based on artificial neural networks with the back-propagation algorithm, to map two different transformations: (1) EMG - joint angles; and (2) EMG - joint moments. Normal data for 16 muscles and three joint moments and angles (hip, knee, and ankle) were adapted from the literature [Winter (1987), The Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Gait]. Both networks were successfully trained to map the input vector onto the output vector. The models were tested by feeding in an input vector where all 16 muscles were slightly different (20\%) from the training data, and the predicted output vectors suggested that the models were valid. The trained networks were then used to perform two separate simulations: 30\% reduction in soleus activity; and removal of rectus femoris. Net 2, in which electromyography was mapped onto joint moments, provided the most reasonable results, suggesting that neural networks can provide a successful platform for both biomechanical modeling and simulation. We believe that this paper has demonstrated the potential of artificial neural networks, and that further efforts should be directed towards the development of larger training sets based on normal and pathological data.},

  abstract = {This paper examined if an electromyography (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model of the human knee could be used to predict knee moments, calculated using inverse dynamics, across a varied range of dynamic contractile conditions. Muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and low-pass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of ∼12Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks.},

  abstract = {Current electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models are used to estimate joint moments measured from an individual׳s extremities during dynamic movement with varying levels of accuracy. The main benefit is the underlying musculoskeletal dynamics is simulated as a function of realistic, subject-specific, neural-excitation patterns provided by the EMG data. The main disadvantage is surface EMG cannot provide information on deeply located muscles. Furthermore, EMG data may be affected by cross-talk, recording and post-processing artifacts that could adversely influence the EMG׳s information content. This limits the EMG-driven model׳s ability to calculate the multi-muscle dynamics and the resulting joint moments about multiple degrees of freedom. We present a hybrid neuromusculoskeletal model that combines calibration, subject-specificity, EMG-driven and static optimization methods together. In this, the joint moment tracking errors are minimized by balancing the information content extracted from the experimental EMG data and from that generated by a static optimization method. Using movement data from five healthy male subjects during walking and running we explored the hybrid model׳s best configuration to minimally adjust recorded EMGs and predict missing EMGs while attaining the best tracking of joint moments. Minimally adjusted and predicted excitations substantially improved the experimental joint moment tracking accuracy than current EMG-driven models. The ability of the hybrid model to predict missing muscle EMGs was also examined. The proposed hybrid model enables muscle-driven simulations of human movement while enforcing physiological constraints on muscle excitation patterns. This might have important implications for studying pathological movement for which EMG recordings are limited.},

  abstract = {Many studies have investigated the relationships between electromyography (EMG) and torque production. A few investigators have used adjusted learning algorithms and feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate joint torque in the elbow. This study sought to estimate net isokinetic knee torque using ANN models. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor torque data were measured simultaneously with agonist and antagonist EMG during concentric and eccentric contractions at joint velocities of 30°/s and 60°/s. Age, gender, height, body mass, agonist EMG, antagonist EMG, joint position and joint velocity were entered as predictive variables of net torque. A three-layer ANN model was developed and trained using an adjusted back-propagation algorithm. Accuracy results were compared against those of forward stepwise regression models. Stepwise regression models included body mass, body height and joint position as the most influential predictors, followed by agonist EMG for concentric and eccentric contractions. Estimation of eccentric torque included antagonist EMG following the agonist activation. ANN models resulted in more accurate torque estimation (R=0.96), compared to the stepwise regression models (R=0.71). ANN model accuracy increased greatly when the number of hidden units increased from 5 to 10, continuing to increase gradually with additional hidden units. The average number of training epochs necessary for solution convergence and the relative accuracy of the model indicate a strong ability for the ANN model to generalize these estimations to a broader sample. The ANN model appears to be a feasible technique for estimating joint torque in the knee.},

Using a neural network to predict the muscle activations from EMG signals avoids establishing a complex mathematical model to express the muscle activation dynamics. The feed-forward neural network model of muscle activations applied here is composed of four layers and uses an adjusted back-propagation training algorithm. In this study, the basic back-propagation algorithm was not applicable, because muscle activation could not be measured, and hence the error between predicted activation and the real activation was not available. Thus, an adjusted back-propagation algorithm was developed. Joint torque at the elbow was calculated from the EMG signals of ten flexor and extensor muscles, using the neural network result of estimated activation of the muscles. Once muscle activations were obtained, Hill-type models were used to estimate muscle force. A musculoskeletal geometry model was then used to obtain moment arms, from which joint moments were determined and compared with measured values. The results show that this neural network model can be used to represent the relationship between EMG signals and joint moments well.},

In each case, surface EMG signals from agonist and antagonist arm muscles detected during seven different movements, three of which involve the simultaneous activation of the shoulder and elbow, were used as inputs to the neural networks. The three configurations were trained to estimate angular displacements of the shoulder and/or elbow. The average correlation coefficient (CC) between the true and the estimated angular position for simultaneous movements for the elbow and shoulder combined was 0.866 ± 0.050 when using the MLP structure, 0.830 ± 0.130 for the TDNN structure and 0.840 ± 0.058 when using the RNN architecture.

  abstract      = {Joint moment is one of the most important factors in human gait analysis. It can be calculated using multi body dynamics but might not be straight forward. This study had two main purposes; firstly, to develop a generic multi-dimensional wavelet neural network (WNN) as a real-time surrogate model to calculate lower extremity joint moments and compare with those determined by multi body dynamics approach, secondly, to compare the calculation accuracy of WNN with feed forward artificial neural network (FFANN) as a traditional intelligent predictive structure in biomechanics. To aim these purposes, data of four patients walked with three different conditions were obtained from the literature. A total of 10 inputs including eight electromyography (EMG) signals and two ground reaction force (GRF) components were determined as the most informative inputs for the WNN based on the mutual information technique. Prediction ability of the network was tested at two different levels of inter-subject generalization. The WNN predictions were validated against outputs from multi body dynamics method in terms of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE (\%)) and cross correlation coefficient (ρ). Results showed that WNN can predict joint moments to a high level of accuracy (NRMSE<10\%, ρ>0.94) compared to FFANN (NRMSE<16\%, ρ>0.89). A generic WNN could also calculate joint moments much faster and easier than multi body dynamics approach based on GRFs and EMG signals which released the necessity of motion capture. It is therefore indicated that the WNN can be a surrogate model for real-time gait biomechanics evaluation.},

Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human-device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim's design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications.

It discusses the anatomy of the final common pathway from the nervous system to muscle, the electrical properties of motor neurons and muscle fibers, and the contractile properties of muscle fibers and motor units. The chapter presents the concept of motor unit types and the control of muscle force by modulating the recruitment and rate coding of motor unit activity. The muscle unit comprises the muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron and corresponds to the peripheral element of the motor unit. The combinations of motor unit recruitment and rate coding that contribute to the actions performed by a muscle vary across its operating range, which requires caution when interpreting details about the activation signal from surface EMG recordings. EMG recordings of muscle fiber action potentials provide information about the activation of motor neurons.},

Specific emphasis is devoted to the generation of muscle fiber action potentials at the fiber end plates, their propagation along the sarcolemma, and their extinction at the tendons. The chapter addresses the topics of crosstalk between nearby muscles and selectivity of the recording systems. It discusses the relationships between muscle force and the surface EMG. The EMG signal is generated by the electrical activity of the muscle fibers active during a contraction. The signal sources are the depolarizing and repolarizing zones of the muscle fibers. EMG signal features depend on a number of anatomical, physical, and detection system parameters. Considering all the factors related to the volume conductor and the signal sources that influence the characteristics of the EMG signal, a reliable relation between EMG amplitude and force needs a subject specific and condition specific calibration.},

This chapter considers different approaches used to uncover the modular organization of the motor output in human behaviors such as responding to postural perturbations, reaching with the arm, and locomotion, as well as its plasticity and flexibility in movement disorders. It also investigates the strategies that the CNS employs to coordinate the activation of many muscles start from electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded simultaneously from many muscles. Different muscle synergies models are used to decompose the EMG envelopes using appropriate factorization algorithms. The chapter further considers the spatiotemporal organization of the activity patterns of leg and trunk muscles during locomotion.},

Muscle forces estimation is important for orthopedists, bio-mechanists, and physical therapists because of joint contact forces. In this work, EMG signal is used to estimate human arm muscle force by implementing a new Back-Propagation neural network (BPNN) model. The proposed model, uses the rectified smoothed electromyography (RSEMG) signals as input to generate the estimated muscle force as an output. To train the system, the Biceps-brachii muscle force was used. To validate our model, the Brachioradialis, Triceps-brachii, and Flexor carpi ulnaris muscles' signals were used. To measure the performance of the model, the BPNN output estimated force is compared with the Hill-Type force estimation. Our results illustrate that. The output of our model is accurate compared with Hell-type model. This can be proved through the regression value of our model which exceeded 99\%. We have used four muscles of the arm to show that our model can estimate the force of any muscle of the hand, which makes it a global hand muscle force estimator.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users. A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996–1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club (>100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.},

  abstract = {Estimation of individual muscle forces during human movement can provide insight into neural control and tissue loading and can thus contribute to improved diagnosis and management of both neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Direct measurement of muscle forces is generally not feasible in a clinical setting, and non-invasive methods based on musculoskeletal modeling should therefore be considered. The current state of the art in clinical movement analysis is that resultant joint torques can be reliably estimated from motion data and external forces (inverse dynamic analysis). Static optimization methods to transform joint torques into estimates of individual muscle forces using musculoskeletal models, have been known for several decades. To date however, none of these methods have been successfully translated into clinical practice. The main obstacles are the lack of studies reporting successful validation of muscle force estimates, and the lack of user-friendly and efficient computer software. Recent advances in forward dynamics methods have opened up new opportunities. Forward dynamic optimization can be performed such that solutions are less dependent on measured kinematics and ground reaction forces, and are consistent with additional knowledge, such as the force–length–velocity–activation relationships of the muscles, and with observed electromyography signals during movement. We conclude that clinical applications of current research should be encouraged, supported by further development of computational tools and research into new algorithms for muscle force estimation and their validation.},

The aim of such models is to estimate or predict muscle forces, joint moments, and/or joint kinematics from neural signals. This is a four-step process. In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the neural signal to a measure of muscle activation-a time varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships. The focus of this paper is on the details involved in the first two steps, since these are the most challenging to the biomechanician. The global process is then explained through applications to the study of predicting isometric elbow moments and dynamic knee kinetics.},

  abstract = {We present a method called muscle synergy analysis, which can offer clinicians insight into both underlying neural strategies for movement and functional outcomes of muscle activity. Although neural dysfunction is central to many motor deficits, neural activity during movements is not directly measurable. Consequently, the majority of clinical tests focus on evaluating motor outputs at the behavioral and kinematic levels. However, altered behavioral or kinematic outcomes could be the result of multiple distinct neural abnormalities with very different muscle coordination patterns. Because muscle activity reflects motoneuron activity and generates the forces that produce behavioral outcomes, an analysis of muscle activity may provide a better understanding of the functional neural deficits in the impaired nervous system. Unfortunately electromyographic datasets can be large, highly variable, and difficult to interpret, precluding their clinical utility. Computational analyses can be used to extract muscle synergies from such datasets, revealing underlying patterns that may reflect different levels of neural function. These muscle synergies are hypothesized to represent motor modules recruited by the nervous system to flexibly perform biomechanical subtasks necessary for movement. For example, hemiparetic stroke patients exhibit differences in the number of muscle synergies, which may reflect disruptions in descending neural pathways and are correlated to deficits in motor function. Muscle synergy analysis may thus offer the clinician a better view of the neural structure underlying motor behaviors and how they change in motor deficits and rehabilitation. Such information could inform diagnostic tools and evidence-based interventions specifically targeted to a patient's deficits.},

We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control. A number of emerging technologies could deliver substantial advantages to existing and future exoskeleton designs.

  abstract  = {In this paper, a novel robust nonlinear model is proposed to predict human lower extremity motion based on the multi-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The prediction model is established by a data-driven dynamic recurrent neural network. The sEMG signals acquired from human lower extremity muscles are used as the inputs of the prediction model. The outputs of the model are joint angles of hip, knee and ankle. Different from the traditional feedforward network structure, this model has several feedback loops, thus it can take advantage of the output feedback information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, five able-bodied people participated in the cycling exercises and relevant data were recorded in real time. The performance of the proposed prediction model is compared to those of the feedforward neural network with augmented inputs (FFNNAI) for the motion prediction accuracy and robustness. The results show that the proposed method provides acceptable performance which is clearly better than the FFNNAI-based approach under different experimental schemes.},

  abstract = {Surface electromyography (EMG) signals have been widely used in locomotion studies and human-machine interface applications. In this paper, a regression model which relates the multichannel surface EMG signals to human lower limb flexion/extension (FE) joint angles is constructed. In the experimental paradigm, three dimensional trajectories of 16 external markers on the human lower limbs were recorded by optical motion capture system and surface EMG signals from 10 muscles directly concerned with the lower limb motion were recorded synchronously. With the raw data, the joint angles of hip, knee and ankle were calculated accurately and the time series of intensity for surface EMG signals were extracted. Then, a deep belief networks (DBN) that consists of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) was built, by which the multi-channel processed surface EMG signals were encoded in low dimensional space and the optimal features were extracted. Finally, a back propagation (BP) neural network was used to map the optimal surface EMG features to the FE joint angles. The results show that, the features extracted from multichannel surface EMG signals using DBN method proposed in this paper outperform principal components analysis (PCA), and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated joint angles and calculated ones during human walking is reduced by about 50\%. The proposed model is expected to develop human-machine interaction interface to achieve continuous bioelectric control and to improve motion stability between human and machine, especially for lower limb wearable intelligent equipment.},

The single-channel techniques address the interference pattern that results from the simultaneous activation of many motor units (MUs). The chapter reviews spectral estimation and traditional stochastic models applicable to the electromyographic (EMG) signal. These models are used to develop, interpret, and test most of the signal processing techniques. EMG amplitude estimates have been assessed via a common application: the use of surface EMG to estimate joint torques. The chapter explores the basic body of knowledge concerning EMG spectral analysis and how physiological parameters are reflected by surface EMG power spectra. It further focuses on the theoretical basis for the assessment of muscle fatigue during high-intensity isometric constant force contractions since this assessment is by far the most prevalent application of surface EMG spectral analysis.},

Such techniques are based on multichannel detection by means of one dimensional (1-D) or two dimensional (2-D) electrode arrays. The chapter describes the electrode-skin interface and the front-end amplifier stage. The impedance between two electrodes is the sum of two electrode-skin impedances plus the interposed tissue impedance. Conventional electrodes, either wet or dry, behave like transducers converting ionic current (in tissue and gel) into flow of electrons in the metal. These electrical sensors require a careful skin preparation to reduce the impedance and noise associated to this interface. The biomedical sector offers small-sized, high-cost application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) devices for biopotential measurements. Applications are expected to range from physiopathological investigations, to rehabilitation games, biofeedback applications, and sport training.},

Force plates embedded in the floors of motion analysis laboratories measure force transfer between foot and ground during gait. Kinematics, kinetics, and surface electromyography (sEMG) are used to identify the causes of motion impairment and the resulting compensatory movements, thus enhancing clinical assessment and supporting decisions such as choice of surgery, orthoses, and rehabilitation protocols. Surface EMG can provide information on the origin of motion produced by muscle activation. EMG during task execution enables muscle activities to be assessed rather than inferred from a combination of observation of movements and clinical evaluation performed under static conditions. To ensure data reliability in applications of motion analysis, raw sEMG data on a fixed y-axis scale must be checked before five criteria: filtering, envelope computation, data normalization, clinical report creation, and statistical analysis for research purposes.},

  abstract = {Analyses of joint moments are important in the study of human motion, and are crucial for our understanding of e.g. how and why ACL injuries occur. Such analyses may be affected by artifacts due to inconsistencies in the equations of motion when force and movement data are filtered with different cut-off frequencies. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of these artifacts, and compare joint moments calculated with the same or different cut-off frequency for the filtering of force and movement data. 123 elite handball players performed sidestep cutting while the movement was recorded by eight 240Hz cameras and the ground reaction forces were recorded by a 960Hz force plate. Knee and hip joint moments were calculated through inverse dynamics, with four different combinations of cut-off frequencies for signal filtering: movement 10Hz, force 10Hz, (10–10); movement 15Hz, force 15Hz; movement 10Hz, force 50Hz (10–50); movement 15Hz, force 50Hz. The results revealed significant differences, especially between conditions with different filtering of force and movement. Mean (SD) peak knee abduction moment for the 10–10 and 10–50 condition were 1.27 (0.53) and 1.64 (0.68) Nm/kg, respectively. Ranking of players based on knee abduction moments were affected by filtering condition. Out of 20 players with peak knee abduction moment higher than mean+1SD with the 10–50 condition, only 11 were still above mean+1SD when the 10–10 condition was applied. Hip moments were very sensitive to filtering cut-off. Mean (SD) peak hip flexion moment was 3.64 (0.75) and 5.92 (1.80) under the 10–10 and 10–50 conditions, respectively. Based on these findings, force and movement data should be processed with the same filter. Conclusions from previous inverse dynamics studies, where this was not the case, should be treated with caution.},

  abstract = {Background
The Conventional Gait Model (CGM), known by a variety of different names, is widely used in clinical gait analysis. We present pyCGM2, an open-source implementation of the CGM with two versions. The first, CGM1.0, is a clone of Vicon Plug In Gait (PiG) with all its variants. CGM1.0 provides a platform to test the effect of modifications to the CGM on data collected and processed retrospectively or to provide backward compatibility. The second version, CGM1.1, offers some practical modifications and includes three well documented improvements.
Research question
How do improvements of the conventional gait model affect joint kinematics and kinetics?
Method
The practical modifications include the possibility to use a medial knee epicondyle marker, during static calibration only, to define the medio-lateral axis of the femur in place of the knee alignment device. The three improvements correspond to the change of pelvis angle decomposition sequence, the adoption of a single tibia coordinate system, and the default decomposition of the joint moments in the joint coordinate system. We validated the outputs of version CGM1.0 against Vicon-PiG, and estimated the effect of the modifications included in version CGM1.1 using gait data collected in 16 healthy participants.
Results
Kinematics and kinetics of CGM1.0 were superimposed with that of Vicon-PiG, with root mean square differences less than 0.04° for kinematics and less than 0.05 N.m.kg-1 for kinetics.
Significance
The differences between the CGM1.1 and CGM1.0 were minimal in the healthy participant cohort but we discussed the expected difference in participants with different gait pathologies. We hope that the pyCGM2 will facilitate the systematic testing and the use of improved processing methods for the conventional gait model.},

  abstract      = { In the literature, conventional 3D inverse dynamic models are limited in three aspects related to inverse dynamic notation, body segment parameters and kinematic formalism. First, conventional notation yields separate computations of the forces and moments with successive coordinate system transformations. Secondly, the way conventional body segment parameters are defined is based on the assumption that the inertia tensor is principal and the centre of mass is located between the proximal and distal ends. Thirdly, the conventional kinematic formalism uses Euler or Cardanic angles that are sequence-dependent and suffer from singularities. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new generic method for inverse dynamics. This generic method is based on wrench notation for inverse dynamics, a general definition of body segment parameters and quaternion algebra for the kinematic formalism. },

Nevertheless, the guidance forces of an exoskeleton may influence the sensory inputs, sensorimotor interactions and resulting muscle activity patterns during stepping. The aim of this study was to report the muscle activation patterns in a sample of intact and injured subjects while walking with a robotic exoskeleton and, in particular, to quantify the level of muscle activity during assisted gait. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity of different leg and arm muscles during overground walking in an exoskeleton in six healthy individuals and four spinal cord injury (SCI) participants. In SCI patients, EMG activity of the upper limb muscles was augmented while activation of leg muscles was typically small. Contrary to our expectations, however, in neurologically intact subjects, EMG activity of leg muscles was similar or even larger during exoskeleton-assisted walking compared to normal overground walking. In addition, significant variations in the EMG waveforms were found across different walking conditions. The most variable pattern was observed in the hamstring muscles. Overall, the results are consistent with a non-linear reorganization of the locomotor output when using the robotic stepping devices. The findings may contribute to our understanding of human-machine interactions and adaptation of locomotor activity patterns.},
