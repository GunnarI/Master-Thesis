\label{sec:methods}
The process from data collection to training and finally using the \ac{NN} is presented in figure \ref{fig:process-diagram}. 
The process can be divided into 5 steps (A-E) and each step will be the subject of each subsection in this chapter, in the same order.

\section{Experiment setup}
For the experiment (step A of figure \ref{fig:process-diagram}), a motion lab equipped with 10 Vicon Vantage V16 cameras and 3 AMTI OR6 \acp{FP} was used. 
Figure \ref{fig:cgm23-markerset} shows the markerset protocol used, which follows the CGM2.3 model's protocol. 
CGM2.3 is a recent version of CGM2.i project which is meant to update the old \ac{CGM} by improving it and fixing some known issues \cite{Leboeuf2019}. 
Section \ref{sec:pyCGM2} goes into further detail about the model and its scripts.

% The knee joint center has its own coordinate system where the x-axis (red) and z-axis (blue) define the sagittal plane in which rotation around the y-axis (green) defines flexion and extension of the knee.

The aktos nano \ac{sEMG} sensors from myon were used for the \ac{EMG} data capture. 
The sensors were placed on the surface near 12 muscles on the right leg, presented in table \ref{tab:muscle-names}. Skin preparation and placement recommendations from the SENIAM project \cite{Stegeman2007, Hermens1999, Hermens2000} were used. The SENIAM project is a European concerted action in the Biomed 2 program of the European Community \cite{Stegeman2007}. It provides recommendations when measuring \ac{sEMG} to increase standardization within the field.

All the data from the \ac{EMG} sensors (muscle activity), cameras (marker trajectories), and the \acp{FP} (\ac{GRF}) was collected and synchronized using the Vicon Nexus 2.8.2 system/software.
The synchronization includes accounting for the latency of $14ms$ of the \ac{EMG} sensors \cite{aktosEMG}.
The marker trajectories were sampled at 100Hz using the cameras while the analog data (i.e. \ac{GRF} and \ac{EMG}) was sampled at 1000Hz.

Data was collected from x subjects with anthropometric data measured for each subject (see table \ref{tab:subject-table}).
The subjects were asked to walk front and back over the \acp{FP} either slowly, normally, or fast.
This was to increase variance in the data and thus help prevent overfitting of the \ac{NN} model.
Note that a subject refers to one individual, a session refers to each experiment performed by the subject, and a trial refers to each measured exercised performed in the trial. 
Thus, each subject can have many sessions (i.e. experiments conducted on separate days), and each session has many trials where, for example, walking 10 times results in 10 separate trials.
Furthermore, each trial was cut down to gait cycles defined by the interval from the right foot's heel strike on a \ac{FP} until its next heel strike.
Some sessions included 3 \acp{FP} resulting in some trials having two gait cycles.

\section{Data processing}
In step B of figure \ref{fig:process-diagram}, before running \ac{IK} and \ac{ID}, the marker trajectories and the \ac{GRF} were filtered with a 4th order Butterworth lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of $10Hz$. 
Same cutoff frequency was used to minimize an artifact introduced in the joint moment at heel strike, due to a spike in reaction force at that time \cite{Kristianslund2012}.
The \ac{EMG} was filtered with the "typical" steps as mentioned by \textcite[99]{Clancy2016}, but excluding the whitening step to keep the filtering real-time friendly.
Thus, the signal was noise and interference filtered using Butterworth IIR bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies $10-100Hz$. 
Then, for demodulation, smoothing, and relinearization, the RMS method was used where the smoothing was done with a moving average window of $50ms$. 
As \textcite{Clancy2016} point out, it is common to use a window of $100-250 ms$ but for the purpose of keeping the solution real-time friendly $50ms$ was chose.
That is, to not introduce too much delay while still keeping the signal relatively smooth.

\section{Training preparation}
Finally, the \ac{EMG} signal was downsampled to match the frequency of the model outputs which was $100Hz$. 
The downsampling was done by simply taking the first \ac{EMG} sample from every $10ms$ windows. 
The first sample from the window was used rather than any other to decrease the delay from \ac{EMG} to moment prediction. 
In that way an \ac{EMG} sample taken at $t$ can predict a moment value at $t+9ms$. 
% The downsampling is only necessary for the training, not for running the \ac{NN} in real-time.

The pyCGM2 package by \textcite{Leboeuf2019} was used to apply \ac{IK} and \ac{ID} on the motion and force data.
The \ac{ID} computations are based on anthropometric segment measurements according to \textcite{Dempster1955} and the iterative Newton-Euler equations as described by \textcite{Dumas2004}.
The model outputs are designed to have the same conventions as Vicon's \ac{PiG} model, and as such are normalized to the subject's height and body mass \cite{Leboeuf2019, viconpig}.

Before training the network in step D, the \ac{EMG} data and joint moments data was split into training and testing set.
Furthermore, for the purpose of standardizing the data between subjects, the datasets were normalized.
\ac{EMG} was normalized so that all values from the training dataset were between $0$ and $1$, independent of subject.
The normalization is given by equation \ref{eq:emg-normalization}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:emg-normalization}
    X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the \ac{EMG} value to be normalized and $X_{min}$ and $X_{max}$ are, respectively, the minimum and maximum measured \ac{EMG} from the training dataset. 
The testing dataset uses the same minimum and maximum values, to accurately portray new data that the \ac{NN} does not already "know".
The moments were normalized similar to the \ac{EMG} in equation \ref{eq:emg-normalization} with addition clause to set the interval:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:moment-normalization}
    X_{norm} = \frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}\left(1 - \frac{X_{min}}{X_{max}}\right) + \frac{X_{min}}{X_{max}}
\end{equation}
where $X$ represents moment values. 
The extra clause made sure the signal was scaled down to the interval $[-1,1]$ (assuming $\left|X_{min}\right| \leq \left|X_{max}\right|$) and that flexion and extension was still represented with positive and negative values respectively.

\section{Architecture and Training of the Neural Network}
TensorFlow \cite{tensorflow2015-whitepaper} and the Keras API \cite{chollet2015keras} were used for constructing and training the \ac{NN}.
.... Talk about the design of the \ac{NN}

% Introduce TensorFlow and the Keras API for the implementation of the \ac{NN}.
% The training set for the \ac{NN} is normalized EMG data from regular walking.
% The training labels are the corresponding joint torque values obtained from Vicon Nexus CGM2.

% \section{Data collection and Inverse Dynamics}
% Before running inverse dynamics on the model, the force plate and trajectory data is filtered. A 4th order Butterworth lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of $10Hz$ is used here. Same cutoff frequency is used for both the force plate data and the trajectory data to minimize an artifact introduced in the joint moment at heel strike, due to a spike in reaction force at that time \cite{Kristianslund2012}.

% \section{Surface-EMG filtering and feature extraction}
% The filtering steps are \parencite[99]{Clancy2016}:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Noise and interference filtering using Butterworth IIR bandpass filter with cutoff frequencies $10-100Hz$
%     \item Temporal decorrelation (or whitening) to get rid of correlation from neighboring EMG channels
%     \item Demodulation (this could be taking RMS?)
%     \item Smoothing: moving average with a window of $20ms$, i.e. 20 samples. As \citeauthor{Clancy2016} points out, it is common to use a window of $100-250 ms$ but for the purpose of keeping the solution real-time friendly $20ms$ is chosen to not introduce too much delay.
%     \item Relinearization
% \end{enumerate}
