\chapter{Conclusions}
In some cases, the model was able to generalize between sessions or subjects, but in other cases it failed to generalize well enough.
The study included too few subjects with enough data to train on for a meaningful conclusion.
It is difficult to conclude why the model failed in some cases. 
Perhaps it could be fixed with more test subject and more variation in the data.
Further research is needed to answer that question.
However, the model was able to generalize rather well in one case, where the test set was a different subject than those that had been used during training.
This indicates that this model could be used in some cases.
Perhaps where the subjects have similar muscle activation patterns.
This is further supported by the result from where the model was trained on one session and tested on another session from the same subject.
